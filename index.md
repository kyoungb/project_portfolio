# Hello! I'm Katie üëã

Welcome to my data science portfolio! This site shows my journey as I learn data science and analytics. Here you'll find projects that demonstrate what I've learned and discovered as I've practiced and developed valuable technical skills.

## üéì About This Portfolio

This portfolio shows my journey as I work to learn to apply data science principals. Each project includes:

- My code with documentation
- Visualizations I created
- What I discovered

I built this site using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills I'm Learning

- **Programming**: Python, Pandas for data analysis
- **Visualization**: Creating charts with Matplotlib and Seaborn
- **Data Collection**: Getting data from files, websites, and APIs
- **Analysis**: Finding patterns and answering questions with data
