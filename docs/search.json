The two key variables we‚Äôll focus on within our dataset are:\n- Social Media Use (hours per day)\n- Depression (self-reported increase in depressive feelings)\nWe‚Äôll start by importing the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame so we can begin cleaning and analyzing it.\n``` python\nimport pandas as pd\ndf = pd.read_csv('smmh.csv')\n\n```\n\n\nStep 1: Categorize Social Media Use\nTo make comparisons clearer, we‚Äôll categorize respondents into time-use categories based on their daily social media usage.\n-   0 -&gt; Less than an hour\n-   1 -&gt; 1-2 hrs/day\n-   2 -&gt; 2-3 hrs/day\n-   3 -&gt; 3-4 hrs/day\n-   4 -&gt; 4-5 hrs/day\n-   5 -&gt; 5+ hrs/day\n\n\nStep 2: Compute Average Depression by Group.\n\nNext, we‚Äôll calculate how depression scores differ across these categories. A heatmap provides a quick way to visualize the relationship between time spent on social media and self-reported depression.\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2_contingency\nfrom scipy.stats import chi2\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ncrosstabDT = pd.crosstab(index = df.AvgTime , columns = df.Depressed)\nsns.heatmap(crosstabDT, annot = True, fmt='d')\n\nplt.title('Mental Health and Media Use')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nPlot"

    "text": "Results\nLooking at the heatmap, you may notice a trend: the groups reporting the most daily social media use also tend to show higher depression scores. To better quantify this relationship, let‚Äôs calculate the average depression score for each category using python‚Äôs averages functions.\ndata = {\n    \"Depressed\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],\n    \"Less than an Hour\": [14, 12, 4, 2, 2],\n    \"Between 1 and 2 hours\": [13, 18, 20, 8, 11],\n    \"Between 2 and 3 hours\": [13, 21, 21, 27, 19],\n    \"Between 3 and 4 hours\": [10, 10, 30, 22, 21],\n    \"Between 4 and 5 hours\": [5, 10, 15, 24, 13],\n    \"More than 5 hours\": [5, 12, 27, 33, 39]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data).set_index(\"Depressed\")\n\n\naverages = {}\nfor col in df.columns:\n    total_counts = df[col].sum()\n    weighted_sum = (df.index * df[col]).sum()  \n    averages[col] = weighted_sum / total_counts\n\n\navg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient=\"index\", columns=[\"Average Depression Score\"])\nHere‚Äôs a summary table of the results:\n\n\n\nSocial Media Use\nAvg. Depression Score\n\n\n\n\n0 (&lt;1 hr/day)\n2.00\n\n\n1 (1-2 hrs/day)\n2.80\n\n\n2 (2-3 hrs/day)\n3.18\n\n\n3 (3-4 hrs/day)\n3.37\n\n\n4 (4-5 hrs/day)\n3.45\n\n\n5 (5+ hrs/day)\n3.77\n\n\n\n\nVisualization\nTo make this trend easy to see, let‚Äôs plot these averages as a bar chart with matplotlib.pyplot and pandas packages!\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Data (from previous calculation)\naverages = {\n    \"Less than an Hour\": 2,\n    \"Between 1 and 2 hours\": 2.8,\n    \"Between 2 and 3 hours\": 3.18,\n    \"Between 3 and 4 hours\": 3.37,\n    \"Between 4 and 5 hours\": 3.45,\n    \"More than 5 hours\": 3.77\n}\n\n# Convert to DataFrame\navg_scores = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(averages, orient=\"index\", columns=[\"Average Depression Score\"])\n\n# Plot as bar chart\nax = avg_scores.plot(kind=\"bar\", legend=False, figsize=(8,5), color=\"skyblue\")\n\n# Titles and labels\nplt.title(\"Average Depression Score by Time Spent\", fontsize=14)\nplt.xlabel(\"Average Time Category\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Average Depression Score\")\nplt.xticks(rotation=45, ha=\"right\")  # tilt labels for readability\nplt.ylim(0,5)  # since scores are on a 1‚Äì5 scale\n\n# Show chart\nplt.show()\n\n\n\nBar chart\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nFrom this simple analysis, a clear pattern emerges: higher reported depression is associated with heavier social media use.\n\n\nStrengths: The dataset is relatively large, making trends easier to detect.\n\nLimitations:\n\n\nCorrelation ‚â† causation.\n\nSelf-reported data introduces bias.\n\nImportant confounders (family, academics, socioeconomic status, etc.) are not included here.¬†\n\n\n\n\nCall to Action\nThis tutorial demonstrates how a few lines of code can uncover meaningful patterns in public health data.\n\nFor students and peers: Try applying these steps to other health-related datasets and share your findings.
